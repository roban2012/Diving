Beautiful islands. We arrived in Waisai with the ferry from Sorong. There our home stay people picked us up with their longboat for a 2 hours trip to Arborek. The sea was bad so we had no chance to visit Wayag or around. We stayed 7 days in Arborek. Snorkelling and diving around the jetty are excellent. Unfortunately, it was not the manta season. We saw only one and that was all. The people are very nice and sweet.<br><br>

Yes it is hard to get here. Yes it is more expensive compared to other places. But it is worth it. I have seen some diving spots, but this is it!!<br><br>
You see there big fish, small fish, fish, fish, fish. It is like an aquarium. The corals are in good condition and "the passage" is a diving spot like a fairy tale.<br><br>
We went with the local dive guides from Kri Island for several dives. You need to be patient with them. Sometimes they have no fuel, sometimes they are really not in time and sometimes they mixed up the diving gear. Sometimes the diving gear was not working properly. I felt only comfortable because I did my Divemaster recently and I knew how to handle it. Be careful with the strong currents at some of the diving spots (specifically at Mike's point).<br><br>
Starting with the Manta spot brings you in the right mood. Again - heaven!!<br><br>

In this article I will explain the three options C budget travel, luxury holiday packages and the option in between C available to travellers who want to visit Raja Ampat.<br><br>

Liveaboard<br><br>

There are a lot of companies operating in and around Raja Ampat, West Papua, offering liveaboard packages for tourists. Packages normally last between one to two weeks and will cost between $1,400 (six nights seven days) C $3,000 (10 nights 11 days) per person. This is an all inclusive price and includes the cost of on average two dives per day. Make sure to check what facilities the vessel has before you make a booking with a company.

From Sorong, we make our way to Waisai Port, where we were taken by boat to our homestay in Gam Island, Raja Ampat. The homestay has 6 attap-roofed huts facing the beach, with 2 new ones underway. Run by 2 brothers, with their families. 3 meals provided, simple local dishes, with free-flowing coffee/tea. The common attap-walled shower hut’s located inside the jungle C after 7pm, you need a torch to find your way there! Except for the insects and birds’ calls from within the jungle, it’s very peaceful in the evenings. And it was HOT, humid and sweaty at night C lights out at 10pm, no aircond, no fans, we literally sweat buckets every night!! We go out to the sea in the day, snorkeling where they take us, visiting villages, making lunch-stops and sand-stops in some of the smaller islands. The waterways are awesome, in wavering shades of blues and greens, its surfaces sparkling in the sun. The waters are crystal-clear, not salty, sometimes shimmering, sometimes still. The coral life is so vibrant and alive, rich in its marine diversity and varieties. And the fishes, gosh! such gloriously beautiful colours and hues, and sizes, too. Surprisingly, we were not sunburnt, even though we were at sea throughout the day. And you get hungry fast, so carry with you cookies/tit-bits in your bag….<br><br>

We just spent an amazing 9 days on the Amira life aboard during an Raja Ampat north tour. The diving was simply amazing and probably the best we ever experienced. The islands and surrounding we passed during this trips are wonderful and real tropical dreams.<br><br>

You have to be aware, that Raja Ampat is a very remote place to go. There are basically to ways to experience the great nature of the area, either with a life aboard or in one of the few resorts. For us the life aboard was the right choice, as it allows to see a bigger area.<br><br>

As for diving, be prepared for sometimes strong currents and not the clearest view. Both things are essential to this area as currents means bringing in plankton which nourishes the vast marine life, lots of plankton tough will reduce the visibility. And yeas there are points to see Mantas with almost a guaranty lucky sharks are still around. As for me the real beauty lies in the Makro life of this extraordinary marine habitat.<br><br>

So you are an experienced diver, you are willing to spend 19 hours in a plane (from europe) and you want to experience the world area with the biggest marine bio diversity? Then GO FOR IT. As for me we will go again whenever possible.

Albeit limited time, my short and express visit to one of the four main islands of Raja Ampat, Papua was overwhelming.
<br><br>
With an express ship from Sorong to Waisai for about two hours, my group and I hurriedly hopped on another fast boat to explore Raja Ampat only in 2-3 hours.<br><br>

We only got a chance to visit two tiny islands, but still, it was an unforgettable.
<br><br>
The water was so clear, the underwater life was also breathtaking.
<br><br>
Encountering a 'black and white' snake and a small stingray swimming on the shore was a thrill for me since I never got a chance to see them on any beach I ever visited before.
<br><br>
The most unforgettable moment was definitely when I witnessed the exotic tiny islands with many different shapes 'floating' along the blue water during the journey.<br><br>

In a nutshell, Raja Ampat is undoubtedly one of the hidden marvels in the east part of Indonesia that is worth visiting.

Any resort in Raja Ampat is difficult to get to. Even if and when the Waisai Airport is ever finished , 1 or 2 boat transfers will be involved to nearly all accommodations. Avoid backpacker homestays. Make no assumptions about basics like electricity, communication in any European language, refrigeration, drinking water, location of sanitary facilities , food, access at high and low tides, internet or phone reception, emergency evacuation, diving, snorkeling, indeed everything! Some vital part(s )of your comfortable stay may be missing, glossed over in the PR blurbs and those professional photographs!. Raja Ampat Dive Lodge is a very good hotel and Kri Eco Lodge a superb dive operation on the best resort snorkeling reef. I spent a week at both. Both these operations offer snorkeling right out of your ocean front rooms. Even the cheapest rooms at RADL offer aircon and hot running water.Both are highly recommended to divers, snorkelers, paradise vacationers. I stayed 2 nights between those weeks in a seriously incomplete, inadequate backpackers homestay advertised as a resort! Their rack-rate package was about the same cost as a non-diving package at Kri which is in a class of it's own.

Water is very rich of plancton so visibility may be not so good in some spots. Islands are very green with limestone coasts. Beaches are not very big. Kabui bay is beautiful (pinnacle islands, forest cave you can reach swimming). Plan trips with speed boats along the islands.<br><br>

This group of about 1600 mostly uninhabited islands off Sorong has some of the best diving in the world. It’s definitely a highly recommended trip although it might take you a while to get there.<br><br>

Little known until the last few years, Raja Ampat’s sheer numbers and diversity of marine life as well as its huge, largely pristine coral-reef systems are a scuba dream come true. The islands are a truly natural phenomenon with enormous biological diversity. The amazing marine landscape means that underwater photography was on the top of my list during our stay. Yes, you guessed right, the usual team, Rochelle and I had a one-week-escape from Bali. Sparsely populated islands, white-sand beaches, hidden lagoons, spooky caves, weird mushroom-shaped islets and pellucid waters, in other words an isolated paradise.<br><br>
The best way to get around is probably on top of a liveaboard. Arriving in Sorong after a 6-hour flight and after another 6 hours of stopover time is not probably the best introduction but anyway that’s what happened to us. We picked Wicked Diving as our liveaboard operator and their beautiful pirate ship “The Jaya” which proved to be a wise choice.
On board the “Jaya” everybody was wonderful. From the local crew to dive instructors and guides you couldn’t ask for a better combination. Our trip seemed more like a scientific expedition than a dive liveaboard. The knowledge that these guys have blows your mind.<br><br>

Cheers, guys, thank you for all your effort and patience. It was an honor to dive with you.
<br><br>

Our trip took us to the southwest of the archipelago. The four biggest islands are Waigeo (with the small but fast-growing regional capital, Waisai), Batanta, Salawati and Misool. The Dampier Strait between Waigeo and Batanta has many outstanding dive sites, so most accommodation options are on Waigeo, Batanta or on the three smaller islands between them: Kri, Gam and Mansuar.<br><br>
On board of the “Jaya”, apart from the seven people that made up the local crew (Sorry, guys, for not remembering your names) were Steve and Pit, Martyn, Ricky and Prue as our dive instructors and guides. As for the rest of us12 guests, this is how we were described on their blog:<br><br>
-Dutch pals Alexander-bump-his-head-alot and Ronni with the extraordinary wardrobe (or so we hear); UK solo travellers and professional shark spotters Sabrina and Kate; Eve and Gidi who are having a break from their children in Israel; Ruthless worm players Boris and Christine from Germany; Excitable Singaporean Sharon; The couple who are pretty sure they got married in Korea, Zeph and Jennifer (USA and Canada) and Ioannis from Greece and his better half Rochelle from Australia who are both having respite from their life in Bali, the lucky devils. I almost forgot to mention the dive instructor and walking shark fetishist Beck that posted this.<br><br>
Time went by really fast but what a time that was. Mother Nature at its finest. My days’ rundown: diving with manta rays, sharks and shoals of schooling fish, exploring reef slopes with some of the widest diversity of corals in the world and experiencing the best macro diving of Raja Ampat. And as if this wasn’t enough, at the end of the day a perfect ocean sunset view from the deck of the “Jaya”. Sounds good? Wait until you actually live it.<br><br>

What can I say?<br><br>

Diving in Raja Ampat, is diving some of the best dive sites in the world! Diving them with wicked was great. You can feel they love what they do, they were engaging and highly professional - gave excellent dive briefings, found amazing dive sites, always checked the current (but sometimes we found out current do change:-)). 3-4 dives a day, and with only 12 divers + 3 dive masters, you're sure to see spectacular things (really is amazing not diving with 50 other divers in the water)<br><br>

The "Jaya" is a good boat. No power after 9.30 pm - yes batteries make sure there's light if you need it. No ac, but small fans, and it could get a little hot, but not really a problem. No telephone reception or internet - to us this was a major plus, as it allowes you to truly relax, and spend time with your fellow divers, maybe with a game of "Regenwurmer" (careful it's addictive). Rooms are a bit small (as we expected), and there's 3 bathrooms for sharing - not really a problem, only one time did I wait 10 min to get a shower. Food is great and plentiful - one day we even had spagetthi bolognese, nice after days with rice.<br><br>

Thank you to Steve, Pit and Martyn for an amazing wicked trip - and to Koen for quick replys to my many e mails.

Chinese cuisine with a lot of different menu. There's no pork in this restaurant. The place a little bit small, so it's better for you to grab it home or hotel.<br><br>

The sea food are so-so cooked, the taste you can find anywhere in hawker stall, but the price they give as expensive as the stars hotel price.. the atmosphere as well is so 'warung'.. nothing special in there.. everything is average<br><br>

Saya datang ke Rumah makan ini malam hari ketika hujan bersama teman-teman kantor. Menu yang kami pesan adalah sup, ikan bakar, cah kangkung. Menu pertama sup, Sup yang kami cicipi rasanya hangat sekali, nyam nyamm, cocok di lidah saat hujan. Yang jadi menu special buat saya di sini adalah ikan bakarnya. Kita bisa memilih sendiri ikan yang masih segar untuk dibakar. Rasanya enak sekali. Bukan karena bumbunya yang spesial, tapi karena ikan yang ada di rumah makan ini memang masih segar. Tekstur dan rasa daging ikan yang masih segar sangat enak sekali. Kekurangannya menurut saya adalah harganya yang lumayan menguras kantong.

Toen wij in Sorong waren hebben we heerlijk gegeten bij Rumah Makan Ratu Sayang: voor ons is het een van de beste seafood-restaurants die er in Sorong te vinden zijn!<br><br>
Wanneer je het restaurant binnenkomt kun je kiezen welke vis je wilt eten: de vis wordt vervolgens gevangen en voor jou gegrild, gebakken of gestoomd. Meestal moet je wel even wachten voor het eten klaar is maar ondertussen kun je genieten van het schitterende uitzicht en een exotisch drankje.<br><br>
Ik vond het wel jammer dat de rust op een gegeven moment werd verstoord door mensen die nogal luidruchtig bezig waren met Karaoke... Maar verder was het eten goed, ook de heerlijke desserts die het restaurant serveert,
Kortom, een bezoek aan Rumah Makan Ratu Sayang is zeer zeker de moeite waard!<br><br>
